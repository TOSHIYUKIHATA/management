# README

This application was developed for those who manage construction.
I am aiming to create a site that can be viewed on both a PC and a smartphone.

I have no skill as an engineer.
This app is also a curriculum at the engineering school.

Someday I would like to create something like this app that can be used in the field.

There are many things that are lacking in functionality, but please tell me how to solve it.

I will study hard, dreaming of the day I get used to your power.

Thank you
